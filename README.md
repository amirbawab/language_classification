It is a Dialog Language Classification task. The goal is to devise a machine learning algorithm to analyze short conversations, and automatically classify them according to the language of the conversation. There are five languages in the corpus: {0: Slovak, 1: French, 2: Spanish, 3: German, 4: Polish}

This is a project for COMP-551 Applied Machine Learning. For this task, we would be implementing Naive Bayes and k-NN from scratch, and trying other ML algorithms using scikit-learn.
